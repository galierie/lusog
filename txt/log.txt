                    the renaming algorithm
                    the algorithm for when "Biological Sex" and "Age" (change in age group) input changes 
                Added an if statement that checks whether or not a z-score calculator has an inputted name
            Changed the tag IDs for "status" and "chart-wrapper"
            Optimized init-calc.js by using array functions on gSheets[] and atIndic[] to look for anthropometric indicator data
        make-chart.js
            Added searchChart()
            Modified baseChart() to include
                the new IDs for the "status" and "chart-wrapper" tags

        calc-input.js
            Modified newData() 
                to remove comments about saving data to .csv file
                so that processing the new dataset for the input can actually take in any number  
            Modified all interpretation functions so that index actually has to be determined by finding the index of the x-value (findIndex()), not just equating the x-value to the index
        base-data.js
            Modified atIndic[] to include the weight-for-height code
            Modified gSheets[]
