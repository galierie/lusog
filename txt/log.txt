        styles.css
            Deleted 
                #kid-amount-div 
                #kid-name-div
                #kid-amount

                window.onload
            Modified
                "add-kids".onclick: 
                    does not call getKidAmount() anymore
                    made it call buildCalc()
                buildCalc(): 
                    no more parameters
                    made it check if the input tag in "kid-name" has a value (kidName)
                    made it modify HTML IDs accordingly 

    10:34AM - 11:22AM, 12:10PM - 12:19PM 
    Initialized recurring HTML element structures ("status" and "chart-wrapper") through JavaScript

        index.html 
            Modified "status" and "chart-wrapper": deleted specific child structures and replaced it with a general template
        init-calc.js
            Made buildNutriCharts()
            Modified
                buildNutriStatus(): transferred a subsection of the code to buildNutriCharts()
                buildCalc(): to include buildNutriCharts() when buildNutriStatus() is called

    Extensive Changes. 
        Done with W4A, H4A, and BMI4A.
        Fixed renaming and input changes for biological sex and age.

        index.html
            Added an input tag for the date
            Modified all input tag IDs 
            Added a dropdown to the "Biological Sex" input tag
        init-calc.js
            in buildCalc()
                Fixed 
                    the renaming algorithm
                    the algorithm for when "Biological Sex" and "Age" (change in age group) input changes 
                Added an if statement that checks whether or not a z-score calculator has an inputted name
            Changed the tag IDs for "status" and "chart-wrapper"
            Optimized init-calc.js by using array functions on gSheets[] and atIndic[] to look for anthropometric indicator data
        make-chart.js
            Added searchChart()
            Modified baseChart() to include
                the new IDs for the "status" and "chart-wrapper" tags
                array destructuring instead of making an array
            Modified inputChart() to include all "Biological Sex" and "Age" related chart object attributes (labels and title) when updating the chart
        base-data.js
            Added 
                a template for the "Weight-for-Height" in gSheets[]
                catch function to loadData()
                searchData()
                atIndic[]
        calc-input.js
            Modified newData() 
                to reflect changes in "status" and "chart-wrapper" tag IDs
                to use array destructuring instead of making an array

Apr. 20
    6:43PM - 7:11PM, 8:26PM - 10:38PM
    Fixed the weight-for-height interpretation function

        calc-input.js
            Modified newData() 
                to remove comments about saving data to .csv file
                so that processing the new dataset for the input can actually take in any number  
            Modified all interpretation functions so that index actually has to be determined by finding the index of the x-value (findIndex()), not just equating the x-value to the index
        base-data.js
            Modified atIndic[] to include the weight-for-height code
            Modified gSheets[] 
                to include the Google Sheet tabs for weight-for-height
                to include another age group ("infant")
        init-calc.js
            Modified buildCalc() to include weight-for-height in processing input

Apr. 21
    2:13PM - 3:03PM
    Actually made a z-score calculator

    base-data.js
        Modified configData()
            to include three more parameters: bc, median, and coeff_var
            to change the variable name for the 0SD z-score values
    calc-input.js
        Made zCalc() to compute z-scores using the LMS method
        Morphed all of the interpretation functions into one function (interpretNutriStatus())
        Modified newData() to simplify its code

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apr. 22 - 23
    Whole day
    Had to update the UI for index.html and calculator.html

    Entire website
        Explored around Bootstrap Studio
        Changed the color palette
        Styled the navigation bar, header, and footer with the new colors
            Took a lot of time in styling the buttons

    index.html
        Deleted a section of the landing page
        Filled up the landing page a bit

    calculator.html
        Redid the z-score calculator UI

    init-calc.js
        Combined buildNutriStatus() and buildNutriCharts() into buildReport()

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apr. 24 - 25
    1:00PM - Whole day
    Had to update the UI for calculator.html

    Entire website
        Changed the fonts
        Styled the heading, p, a, label, and input HTML tags with the new fonts

    calculator.html
        Researched about form input UIs
        Learned about a user-made button to actually make the result report modal open
        Styled the results summary to open beside the z-score calculator
            Updated init-calc.js to go along with it
            Took up most of my time becuase everytime either calculator.html or init-calc.js gets updated, I have to add a new HTML element structure to make the thing work

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apr. 28
    9:17AM - 10:18AM
    Minor updates to calculator.html UI; finally pushed to GitHub

    calculator.html
        Tried to change the UI of the results summary; ended up not changing it
